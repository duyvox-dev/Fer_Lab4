            "The tome follows Marsha Sprinkle, a suitcase thief, scammer and master of disguise. Dogs and children hate her. Her own family wants her dead.

        description:
            "With Lila Neugebauer in the director's chair, working from a script by Ottessa Moshfegh, Luke Goebel and Elizabeth Sanders, Causeway finds Lawrence as Lynsey, a military engineer who has returned to the States from Afghanistan with a debilitating brain injury after an IED explosion.It's a painful and slow recovery as she relearns to walk and re-trains her memory, aided by a chatty but tender caretaker (Jayne Houdyshell). But when she returns home to New Orleans she has to face memories even more aching and formative than those she had in service: a reckoning with her childhood.",

        title: "Empire Podcast Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Trailer Breakdown Special",
        description:
            "The second trailer for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever didn't hold back on the emotion that is clearly going to drive Ryan Coogler's MCU mega-sequel, following the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, but it also filled in more of the film's blanks, plot-wise, hinted at some major action sequences, and preserved the mystery of just who is going to take over as the new Black Panther.Plenty, then, for Chris Hewitt, Helen O'Hara, and Amon Warmann to dig into in this trailer breakdown special, recorded very late at night, and with one of us down with Covid, so if there's even more brain fog than usual, go easy on us. Enjoy.",
